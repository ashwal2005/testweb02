                Every great success story has a myth attached to it, and the same is true for the BMW M logo and colors. The following BMW staff were involved in selecting the colors for the design of the motorsport division at BMW in 1972: Jochen Neerpasch (then race director and co-managing director of BMW Motorsport GmbH), Wolfgang Seehaus (then BMW interior designer), and Manfred Rennen (then BMW exterior designer).

                BMW M GmbH was founded in 1972 as a business unit for the sporty products of the BMW brand. At that time the official name was still BMW Motorsport GmbH. It wasn't until 1993 that it became BMW M GmbH.

The newly created sports car division was meant to combine and professionalize BMWâ€™s racing activities under a single, unified corporate identity. The unifying element for all of this was to be a crisp color scheme. Designer Seehaus was part of the team in charge of it, and he was the one who created the BMW M colors of blue, violet and red.
